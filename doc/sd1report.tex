\section{Abstract}
\noindent This project is focused on the design and implementation of a teleoperated, wheeled mobile robot that is capable of launching a t-shirt projectile. The robot will be holonomic and will consist of a rigid, rectangular chassis and a mounted cannon powered by $\textrm{CO}_2$. A human user will control all robot related tasks, including remotely driving, aiming, and launching the cannon. Both low-level motor controls and high-level coordination of motor speeds will be designed for controlled locomotion. Two on-board microcontrollers will be networked to the operator's computer, and video captured from a robot-mounted camera will be streamed to a heads-up display, which will allow for real-time control and monitoring of the robot. We will demonstrate the constructed chassis design as well as some prototypical control tasks and video streaming.

\section{Introduction}

\subsection{Subject and Purpose}
\noindent Our task was to design a teleoperated, wheeled mobile robot that can launch t-shirts safely at university events. The primary purpose of the robot will be to promote the Erik Jonsson School of Engineering and inspire undergraduates engineering students to gain hands-on experience with university-sponsered engineering projects.

\subsection{Design Objectives}
\noindent The design will meet the following objects:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Operation time \textgreater 10 minutes
    \item Remote Control for up to 50 feet
    \item User Control of Robot Velocities and Cannon Triggering Mechanism
    \item Fire t-shirts between 20 and 150 feet
    \item Send live video stream of the robot's First Person View back to the user
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Design Process}
\noindent We began designing our robot by determining that the drive system would be a 4-wheel omnidirectional drive with a t-shirt launching mechanism attached rigidly to the robot's chassis. Then, a t-shirt launching mechanism was chosen. An electrical system for wirelessly receiving and transmitting commands and controlling the robot's movements and t-shirt launching mechanism was designed. Finally, a software system for handling the robot-user interface was designed. 

\subsection{Final Results}
\noindent We were able to assemble the robot chassis and demonstrate video streaming using a Raspberry Pi and camera module. We also determined and purchased the necessary components for our robot to operate. Finally, we've nearly completed remote control of robot velocities. 

\section{Conceptual and Preliminary Design}

\subsection{Problem Analysis}
\noindent The robot must wirelessly receive and perform velocity and t-shirt launching commands. To perform the commands, the robot must first have a mechanism by which to control its velocity and also a triggering mechanism for the t-shirt launcher. The robot must have a wireless receiver on-board and a camera for first person view streaming. A central controller should coordinate all robot tasks on-board and a power source for both the t-shirt launching mechanism as well as the components dedicated to maneuvering the robot. Following specifications will solve the problem as thus described:
\begin{itemize}
    \item 4-wheel omnidirectional drive
    \item Pneumatic t-shirt Launcher with a shot range between 20 and 150 feet
    \item Single power source for all electrical components
    \item Single microcontroller board that includes a microcontroller and a microprocessor for embedded linux and wireless communication
    \item Highly reconfigurable IP camera
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Decision Analysis}
\noindent We decided for the robot to have 4-wheel omnidirectional drive to allow the user ease of control over the robot's pose. In this configuration, the user will be able to separately control the robot's angular velocity and translational velocity to achieve the desired pose. We chose this configuration over others because it is simpler to implement and pre-existing solutions are readily available at certain vendors. \\

\noindent The robot's original application is to be used during the halftime of basketball games to entertain the crowd. Given the size of UTD's basketball court and bleachers, a shot range between 20 and 150 feet is reasonable for this application. For convenience, a pneumatic cannon capable of firing single shots is a widely available commodity that can be retrofitted for our purposes. \\

\noindent A single power source would be ideal for powering the robot's 4 motors, microcontroller, and other electronic devices. We decided to go with a single power source rather and use up-conversion and down-conversion voltage regulators rather than using multiple power sources. \\ 

\noindent A central microcontroller is needed to control the robot's motion and triggering mechanism. Furthermore, since the robot will need to take wireless commands as input, it would be ideal to wirelessly program the robot's microcontroller as well. We chose this solution over using separate microcontrollers for high and low level commands. \\

\section{Project Implementation and Assessment}
\section{Scope of Work}
\section{Ethics}
\noindent The intent of the t-shirt cannon robot is to aid in the distribution of t-shirt during public events like basketball games and pep rallies in a gym setting. To prevent harm, there will be several precautions that will be taken. Firstly, there will be a hard and soft master kill switch to shut down the robot in case of an emergency. Secondly, the network in which the Raspberry Pi, Arduino Yun, and the laptop are communicating will be password protected, so no one can simply hack into the system. Thirdly, the user who will be manually driving the robot wirelessly will be trained and be monitoring the vehicle in his/her line of sight. Finally, the robot will be decorated so that it will not intimidate or be invisible to the public. 

\section{Cost Estimation}
\section{Project Management Summary}
\section{Conclusion}
\noindent The Teleoperated Mobile Garment Accelerator is designed to promote and bring awareness to the engineering field. The décor and first person vision of the robot will engage the audience in public events.\newline

\noindent In Senior Design II, we will construct a mount to affix the cannon to the chassis. Additionally we will design a reloading mechanism for automatic t-shirt reloading of the cannon. Rigorous testing of the robot’s movement, firing mechanism, and network security will be performed.
