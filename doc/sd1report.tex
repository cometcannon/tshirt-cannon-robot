\section{Abstract}
\noindent This project is focused on the design and implementation of a teleoperated, wheeled mobile robot that is capable of launching a t-shirt projectile. The robot will be holonomic and will consist of a rigid, rectangular chassis and a mounted cannon powered by $\textrm{CO}_2$. A human user will control all robot related tasks, including remotely driving, aiming, and launching the cannon. Both low-level motor controls and high-level coordination of motor speeds will be designed for controlled locomotion. Two on-board microcontrollers will be networked to the operator's computer, and video captured from a robot-mounted camera will be streamed to a heads-up display, which will allow for real-time control and monitoring of the robot. We will demonstrate the constructed chassis design as well as some prototypical control tasks and video streaming.
