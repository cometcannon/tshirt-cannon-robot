Instructions for deploying code to the OpenWrt (Linux) chip on the Yun
----------------------------------------------------------------------

These instructions are intended for use in a *nix environment. They have
been tested specifically on Ubuntu 14.04. Results may vary...

Steps 1-3 are obviously one-time tasks.

---------------------------------
Step 1: clone the openwrt-yun source

$ git clone https://github.com/arduino/openwrt-yun.git
$ cd openwrt-yun/

---------------------------------
Step 2: customize the OpenWrt configuration

$ make menuconfig

keep all defaults except for the starring the following:

[*] Build the OpenWrt based Toolchain

exit and save the configuration

----------------------------------
Step 3: build the OpenWrt image (takes a long time, 1-3 hr)

make

----------------------------------
